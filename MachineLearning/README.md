# MachineLearning 

A collection of notebooks realised by Marie Bétend ([efraika](https://github.com/efraika)) and Félix Desmaretz ([firgaty](https://github.com/firgaty)), as homework for our Machine Learning class [here](https://stephanegaiffas.github.io/teaching/m2mo).

* [fashion](https://github.com/efraika/UniversityProject/blob/main/MachineLearning/fashion.ipynb) is a first step in neuronal network, where we tried to predict lables associated with images from the [fashion mninst data set](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist).
* [diamonds](https://github.com/efraika/UniversityProject/blob/main/MachineLearning/diamonds.ipynb) is a comparision between different prediction tools, applicated to determinate the price of diamonds with information from the [diamonds data set](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds).
